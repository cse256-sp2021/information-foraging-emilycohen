      <h1>Special Programming and Events</h1>

      <h2 id="ph-special-programs">Special Programs</h2>
      <h4>School Picnic</h4> <br />
      Families	are	invited	to	a	school	gathering	at	the	beginning	and	end	of	the	school	year.	
      “Popsicles	at	the	Park”	is	held	the	week	prior	to	school	starting.		This	fun	family	event	at	
      Shaw	Park	allows	children	and	parents	to	get	acquainted	with	new	classmates	and	their	
      teachers.		The	last	week	of	school	families	gather	for	a	dinner/potluck	at	Shaw	Park	to	
      celebrate	the	culmination	of	the	year.
      <br /> <br />

      <h4>Open House</h4>
      <br />
      In	October,	WUNS	holds	an	“open	house”	for	current	children	and	their	families.		This	event	
      allows	parents	and	siblings	to	visit	the	child’s	classroom,	meet	the	teachers	and	play	on	the	
      playground.		Children	are	excited	to	“show-off”	their	school	to	their	family.		
      <br /> <br />

      <h4>After-School	Play	Dates</h4>
      <br />
      We	arrange	times	throughout	the	year	to	have	the	WUNS	playground	open	after	school	from	
      3:15-5:00	p.m.		so	children	and	their	families	can	play.			Siblings	are	welcome	to	join.		All	
      children	must	have	a	parent	or	caregiver	present	to	attend.		
      <br /> <br />

      <h4>Halloween	Parade</h4> <br />
      Parents	are	invited	to	our	annual	Halloween	parade	followed	by	songs	and	snack	in	their	
      child’s	classroom. An	invitation	and	details	will	be	shared	with	all	parents.
      <br /> <br />

      <h4>Donuts	with	Dads	and	Muffins	with	Moms</h4>
      <br /> Parents	are	invited	to	enjoy	time	to	play	in	the	classroom	and	a	special	snack	with	their	
      preschoolers	during	these	special	days	(fall	and	spring).		Children	will	bring	home	invitations	
      and	details	about	each	event.		<br /> <br />

      <h4>Dine Out Nights</h4>
      <br /> The	Nursery	School	partners	with local	restaurants	to	provide	social	gatherings for	families.		
      On	these	Dine	Out	Nights,	families	and	friends	are	encouraged	to	eat	out	at	the	designated	
      restaurant.		Families	enjoy	having	a	meal	with	fellow	WUNS	classmates	and	parents,	while	
      also	supporting	the	Nursery	School. <br /> <br />

      <h4>Night	at	the	Magic	House</h4> <br />
      In	February,	the	Nursery	School	rents	the	early	childhood	section	of	the	Magic	House	for	
      Nursery	School	families.		This	special	night	is	a	huge	hit	with	everyone.		Parents	can	enjoy	a	
      private	night	at	their	child’s	favorite hands-on museum! <br /> <br />

      <h4>Annual Parent Social</h4>
      <br />In	early	spring,	parents	are	invited	to	a	“parent-only”	social	event.		In	the	past	it	has	been	a	
      trivia	night,	gallery	night	(highlighting	preschooler’s	artwork),	and/or	silent	auction.	 Monies	
      raised	help	support	our	enrichment	programs	– Art,	Spanish,	Nature	and	Music,	as	well	as	
      specific	equipment	or	school	needs.<br /> <br />
