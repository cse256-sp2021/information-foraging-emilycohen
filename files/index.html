      At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that every child is
      a unique individual with his or her own pattern and timetable for
      social, emotional, intellectual and physical growth.
    </h4>
    <!-- <p>
      We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered
      activities that effectively engage students. We encourage creativity in
      all areas with a special focus on the arts to enhance language and
      thinking. Above all, our goals are that children will develop a genuine
      pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their ability to
      learn and to accomplish challenging tasks and that they gain experience
      and skills in interacting with others.

              I cannot say enough good things about WUNS. We feel extremely
              lucky to have discovered your nursery school. The staff is
              dedicated, well-trained and (most of all) cares deeply for the
              children. The other families are warm and welcoming, and their
              diversity will hopefully serve as a baseline for...what the
              world should look like.

              It’s wonderful to feel like your child’s caregivers are better
              at the job than you are; truly, on the whole they are more
              patient, better able to see the forest for the trees, certainly
              more trained and aware of what’s developmentally appropriate
              than I am.

              There are many benefits, but problem-solving and being a good
              friend are two of the important things our child is learning at
              WUNS. In small ways–through play, stories, outings, activities
              and pictures–there is so much learning taking place at WUNS
              (great for all abilities and learning styles). WUNS is a diverse
              environment with many opportunities to learn about other
              cultures, customs, foods and traditions that our (child) most
              likely wouldn’t have been exposed to elsewhere.

              Our child loves every minute! He has grown and developed in
              confidence. Teachers allow him to grow at his own pace and work
              with our family in ways that we find incredible.

              The teachers are warm and loving. My child never gave me any
              trouble about going to school. He couldn’t wait to see his
              teachers every day. I feel that the teachers helped my child
              build self-confidence and improve his language skills. I am 100%
              happy with our nursery school choice.

              classroom and the gentle way the teachers encourage the kids to
              try everything. I am thrilled that the kids get to be outside so
              much.
