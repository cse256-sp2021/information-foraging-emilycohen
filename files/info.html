<h2 id="ph-welcome">Welcome</h2>
      <i>Dear	Parents	and	Guardians,<br />
        <br />
        At	the	Nursery	School	we	strive	to	provide	a	great	learning	environment	for	each	and	every	
        child	in	our	care.	We	recognize	that	a	strong	partnership	with	parents	and	clarity	about	
        expectations	for	how	we	will	work	together	in	this	effort	are	critical.	Please	take	time	to	read	
        through	this	Parent	Handbook	and	to	familiarize	yourself	with	its	content.	It	provides	
        important	information	and	helpful	guidance.	We	ask	parents	to	know	and	follow	the	
        procedures	and	rules	contained	in	this	Handbook.	We	hope	it	will	become	your	go-to	source	for	
        information.	<br /> <br />
        Nikki	Scheele,	Director</i>
        <br /> <br />
        At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	every	child	is	a	unique	individual	
        with	his	or	her	own pattern	and	timetable	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual	and	physical	
        growth.
        <br /> 
        We	believe	in	learning	through	play;	we	provide	fun,	child-centered	activities	that	effectively	
        engage	students.	We	encourage	creativity	in	all	areas	with	a	special	focus	on	the	arts	to	
        enhance	language	and	thinking.	Above	all,	our	goals	are	that	children	will	develop	a	genuine	
        pleasure	in	learning,	that	they	develop	confidence	in	their	ability	to	learn	and	to	accomplish	
        challenging	tasks	and	that	they	gain	experience	and	skills	in	interacting	with	others.
        <br /> <br />


<h2 id="ph-philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
  catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
  provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
  developmental	areas. <br /> 
  The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
  approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
  consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
  children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
  class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
  the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
  music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
  and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program
<br /> <br />

<h2 id="ph-history">History</h2>
The	Washington	University	Nursery	School	was	founded	in	1947	as	a	cooperative	venture	of	
  faculty	and	Washington	University	in	St.	Louis.	The	primary	purpose	of	the	nursery	school	is	
  to	provide	the	highest	quality	preschool	program	for	children	2	years	and	7	months	to	5	
  years	of	age.	Today	about	70	percent	of	the	children	are	from	families	of	Washington	
  University	in	St.	Louis	faculty,	staff	and	students, and	the	remaining	are	from	families	in	the	
  community. <br /> <br />
  Children	come	from	a	variety	of	countries,	cultures	and	economic	backgrounds. The	school	
  maintains	the	high	standards	of	the	National	Association	for	the	Education	of	Young	
  Children,	by	which it is	accredited.	It	is	licensed	by	the	State	of	Missouri.
  <br /> <br />
  The	nursery	school	also	serves	as	a	site	for	research	in	child	development.	Washington	
  University	undergraduate	and	graduate	students	are	employed	to	assist in	the	classrooms.	
  The	classroom	teachers,	as	well	as	the	nursery	school’s	director,	supervise	them.	The	student	
  workers’	presence	enables	children	to	receive	additional	individual	attention. <br /> <br />
  The	nursery	school	is	located	on	the	Washington	University	campus.	It	is	composed	of	three	
  classrooms, which	are	designed	to	offer	children	a	variety	of	choices	in	their	play.	Two	
  additional	all-purpose	rooms	are	equipped	with	a	library	and	a	variety	of	indoor	gross	motor	
  play	materials. A	large	outdoor	play	area	gives	children	the	opportunity	to	run,	bike,	swing,	
  climb,	slide	and	play	in	the	sand.
