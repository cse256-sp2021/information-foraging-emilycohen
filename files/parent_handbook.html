      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p><i>Dear	Parents	and	Guardians,<br />
        <br />
        At	the	Nursery	School	we	strive	to	provide	a	great	learning	environment	for	each	and	every	
        child	in	our	care.	We	recognize	that	a	strong	partnership	with	parents	and	clarity	about	
        expectations	for	how	we	will	work	together	in	this	effort	are	critical.	Please	take	time	to	read	
        through	this	Parent	Handbook	and	to	familiarize	yourself	with	its	content.	It	provides	
        important	information	and	helpful	guidance.	We	ask	parents	to	know	and	follow	the	
        procedures	and	rules	contained	in	this	Handbook.	We	hope	it	will	become	your	go-to	source	for	
        information.	<br /> <br />
        Nikki	Scheele,	Director</i>
        <br /> <br />
        At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	every	child	is	a	unique	individual	
        with	his	or	her	own pattern	and	timetable	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual	and	physical	
        growth.
        <br /> <br />
        We	believe	in	learning	through	play;	we	provide	fun,	child-centered	activities	that	effectively	
        engage	students.	We	encourage	creativity	in	all	areas	with	a	special	focus	on	the	arts	to	
        enhance	language	and	thinking.	Above	all,	our	goals	are	that	children	will	develop	a	genuine	
        pleasure	in	learning,	that	they	develop	confidence	in	their	ability	to	learn	and	to	accomplish	
        challenging	tasks	and	that	they	gain	experience	and	skills	in	interacting	with	others.</p>
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas. <br /> <br />
        The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program</p>
